# Lil' ns8 user / event server

This is was from a starter typescript/node project https://github.com/JalpeshVadgama/minimum-nodejs-typescript-express" because that's not fun to do. My philosophy is only do what you need to do at least for this scenario and no db is needed as you already indicated so the data dies when the server dies.

- mocha was not added because this was not a requirement
